# Weather Dashboard

Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to check the current weather and 5-day forecast for various cities worldwide.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
     ```bash

     ```
   
2. **Open the HTML File:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. **API Key Setup:**
   - This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. You need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript code (`weather.js`) with your own API key.

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Once the API key is set up, you can use the Weather Dashboard by entering a city name in the search input field and clicking the "Search" button.

## Usage

1. **Search for a City:**
   - Enter the name of a city in the search input field (e.g., New York, London, Tokyo).

2. **View Weather Information:**
   - After entering a city name and clicking the "Search" button, the application will display the current weather information for the selected city, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

3. **View 5-Day Forecast:**
   - Below the current weather information, you can also view the 5-day forecast for the selected city, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.

4. **Search History:**
   - The application maintains a search history, allowing you to easily revisit previous searches by clicking on the buttons generated for each city in the search history section.
